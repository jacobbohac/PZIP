Nothing fancy -- I haven't written a ./Configure or such
yet.  (Feel free to contribute one if you like! :)

Do

   tar -xjf pzip-0.82.tar.bz2

to extract, then build via

   cd pzip-0.82
   make pzip

You can do

   make check

to verify correct operation.

Compress a file by doing:

   ./pzip -e file file.pz

Uncompress a file by doing

   ./pzip file.pz file

If you have the Calgary Corpus in ../calary/corpus/
you can do

   ./Report

to generate a listing of pzip's performance.
