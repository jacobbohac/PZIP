pzip is a high-compression low-speed (computation
intensive) experimental universal file compression
utility.

It began life as a port to linux of Charles Bloom's
ppmz2 source code, downloaded from his 
http://www.cbloom.com/src/ppmz.html page, together
with Hannu Peltola and Jorma Tarhio's linux port of
Charles's crblib code: http://www.cs.hut.fi/u/tarhio/ppmz

The two have since been merged, pruned from 22,000
lines down to 4000 lines, and then extensively
commented and modified by Cynbe.

I've named it "pzip" to fit into the Linux "gzip" "bzip"
... family of file compressor names, and to avoid confusion
with the original.
